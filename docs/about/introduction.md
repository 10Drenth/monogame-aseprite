## What is MonoGame.Aseprite
**MonoGame.Aseprite** is an extension for the [MonoGame Framework](https://www.monogame.net) that allows you to import [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) \*.ase/\*.aseprite file using the Content Pipeline to use in your game project.

The contents of the import process provides you with an `AsepriteDocument` object, who's properties contain the values of the Asperite file imported. This allows you to use this object in your code in a way that makes sense for your project.

MonoGame.Aseprite also provides an out-of-the-box `AnimatedSprite` class that can be used with the imported content to get you start quickly if you prefer this as well.

To get started using Monogame.Aseprite, please refer to the [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) document in the sidebar.
