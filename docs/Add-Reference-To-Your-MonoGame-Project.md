## Overview
To make use of the AnimatedSprite class in your MonoGame project, as well as loading in the AnimationDefinition content, you'll need to ensure that you've added the **MonoGame.Aseprite.dll** reference to your project.

## Files needed
You can obtain the files needed from Nuget.  If using Visual Studio, you can use the Nuget Package Manager for the project, or using the commands below

**Package Manager**  
```PM> Install-Package MonoGame.Aseprite -Version 1.0.0 ```

**.Net CLI**  
```> dotnet add package MonoGame.Aseprite --version 1.0.0 ```
